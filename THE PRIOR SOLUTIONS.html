	        In primitive areas across the globe, the difficulty of obtaining a reliable water supply has been a significant challenge.
      		However, various solutions have been implemented to address this issue. Here are some prior solutions that have been used in such areas:
            1.	PlayPumps International: PlayPumps International is an organization that developed a water system utilizing children's play equipment.
            They installed water pumps in rural communities that were connected to merry-go-rounds.
            As children played on the equipment, the spinning motion would pump water from underground wells into storage tanks.
            This innovative solution provided a reliable water supply while also engaging children in physical activity.
            2.	Solar-powered Water Systems: Various organizations have implemented solar-powered water systems in remote areas to provide a reliable water supply.
            These systems use solar energy to power pumps that extract water from underground sources or surface water bodies.
            The solar panels generate electricity, which is used to operate the pumps or charge batteries for water storage during periods of low sunlight. 
            3.	Fog Harvesting: In arid regions with low rainfall, fog harvesting projects have been implemented.
            These projects involve the installation of large nets or mesh structures on hills or mountains to capture water droplets from fog.
            The collected droplets condense and drip into collection systems, providing a supplemental water source for communities in water-scarce areas.
            These projects showcase the diverse range of approaches and technologies that have been utilized to address the challenge of obtaining a reliable water supply in primitive areas.
            Each project is tailored to the specific needs and conditions of the communities they serve, and they contribute to improving access to
            clean water and promoting sustainable water management practices.</h3>
