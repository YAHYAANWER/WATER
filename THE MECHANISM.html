       <span><br> The mechanism of our solution:</br> <p><h3 class="hh"></span>  
        Below is a general diagram of the possible mechanism of such a device:
        1. Collection Surface: Design a surface or structure that can be placed close to plants to increase exposure to escaping vapor.
		This surface will have a large surface area and be positioned in a way that allows for efficient steam collection.
		They can be made of a material that encourages condensation, such as cold metal or a specially painted surface.
        2. Steam Capture: Develop a mechanism to capture the steam as it rises from the plants. 
		This could involve directing the steam towards the collection surface using channels or funnels.
		The design should take into account factors like wind direction and airflow around the plants to optimize steam capture.
        3. Condensation: Implement a method for condensing the captured steam into liquid water. 
		This could be achieved by cooling the collection surface or using a separate condensation chamber where the steam is
		cooled and converted back into liquid form. Cooling can be achieved through various means, such as using a cooling coil,
		a heat sink, or even a thermoelectric cooling device.
        4. Water Storage and Purification: Once the steam is condensed into liquid water, it needs to be stored and purified for use.
		Design a storage tank or reservoir to collect and store the condensed water. To ensure its purity, 
		you may need to incorporate filtration systems or other purification methods, depending on the quality of the collected steam 
		and any potential contaminants.
        5. Energy Considerations: We will keep energy in mind and develop ways to reduce energy consumption. 
		This may include using passive cooling techniques, harnessing renewable energy sources such as solar energy,
		or incorporating energy-efficient components.
        6. Monitoring and Control: Include sensors and control mechanisms to monitor the steam collection process, water levels,
		and the overall functioning of the device. This will allow for optimization and adjustments as needed.
        7. Prototype Testing and Refinement: Build a prototype of the device and test it under various conditions to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency.
		Refine the design based on the results of testing and iterate to improve performance. 
        It is important to note that the specific details of the device depend on available resources, experience, and limitations. 
		This general mechanism provides a starting point, but further research and engineering will be needed to develop an effective 
		and effective device for collecting steam from the plants.</h3></p>
