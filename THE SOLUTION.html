            The atmosphere contains an estimated 13,000 km3 of water vapor, some of which can be captured through cloud seeding and the collection of water from fog
            and mist. Remote communities in Chile, Morocco, and South Africa have used vertical mesh nets to harvest fog for over 100 years, 
            and there are viable sites for fog harvesting on every continent. Advancements in materials and indigenous knowledge have helped develop highly productive,
            relatively low-cost, environmentally-friendly designs to collect potable water â€“ more than 20 liters on a dense fog day for every square meter of mesh. 
            At an overall cost of less than $250 per square meter of mesh lasting more than a decade, some 75,000 liters per square meter is produced at a cost of 
            just 33 cents a liter.
            Based on the latest information and data, and with contributions from renowned scientists, practitioners and experts around the world,
            the book showcases the potential of different types of non-conventional water resources. Therefore, we decided to place a device near
            the plants to collect the steam coming out of them during the breathing process and utilize this steam to provide pure water.
